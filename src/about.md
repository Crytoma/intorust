`into_rust()` is a collection of tutorials that are designed to help
you quickly get up to speed coding Rust. These tutorials take an
"Ownership First" approach -- which means that we place a heavy
emphasis on learning how ownership and the borrow checker work, rather
than covering Rust's syntax or other details. The reason for this is
othat ownership is Rust's most unique feature, and is often the one
that people find the most confusing.

### Other places to learn about Rust

Naturally, the official Rust web page has a
[good listing of documentation resources](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/documentation.html)
which include a number of other places to learn about Rust. The
[rust-learning repository](https://github.com/ctjhoa/rust-learning) is
another good source.

### Contributing

Like Rust itself, `into_rust()` is an [open source project][gh]. If
you find errors or have suggestions for improvement, please
[open an issue][issues]. If you'd be interested in helping in other
ways, check out the [README][gh] or the [open issues][issues] on the
repository.

### About the authors

The primary author of these slides, and the narrator on the
screencasts, is Nicholas Matsakis (his friends, and his enemies
really, call him Niko). Niko has been involved in Rust since 2011 and
is a member of the Rust core team as well as the leader of the
language and compiler teams. Niko maintains a blog at
<http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps>. Niko's IRC nick is
`nmatsakis`, and his e-mail is available on
[his GitHub page](https://github.com/nikomatsakis/). Please, feel free
to contact him with questions or comments (though he is perenially
behind on e-mail, so don't be surprised if there is a delay in getting
a response).

[Aaron Turon](https://github.com/aturon/) is another major
contributor. He is a member of the Rust core and language teams.  Like
Niko, he maintains a blog at <http://aturon.github.io/blog/>.

Thanks also go out to [Felix Klock](https://github.com/pnkfelix) and
[Steve Klabnik](https://github.com/steveklabnik)5A, both of whom helped
in the iteration on the current set of slides.
