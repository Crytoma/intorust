In the [shared borrows] tutorial, we learned that how to use shared
references (`&T`) to give temporary, read-only access to data. This
tuturial covers mutable references (`&mut T`), which allow the data to
be mutated while it is borrowed. This tutorial completes the tour of
Rust's ownership model.
